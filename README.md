# TOP-todo-list_B
2nd attempt: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list

Being that I was interrupted in this project for a few months and seeing some lacks in using modules and SOLID principles, I feel it would be good to redo the lessons leading up to this project and then do the project again, focusing on the bare-bones of what is being asked. This allows me to refresh the concepts I learned months ago, correct my mistakes, and move forward.



personal notes:
    -create all in console first (ensure no DOM dependancy)
    -SOLID (focus on single responsibility)

10/9
    -create default todo card template and render in js
