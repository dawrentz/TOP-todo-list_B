# TOP-todo-list_B
2nd attempt: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list

Being that I was interrupted in this project for a few months and seeing some lacks in using modules and SOLID principles, I feel it would be good to redo the lessons leading up to this project and then do the project again, focusing on the bare-bones of what is being asked. This allows me to refresh the concepts I learned months ago, correct my mistakes, and move forward.



personal notes:
    -create all in console first (ensure no DOM dependancy)
    -SOLID (focus on single responsibility)

todo:
    -I could only reset line on edit, not re-render all (better UI)
    -show which project is selected on filter
    -move filter on proj edit (if on that proj)
    -spacing todo data lines
    -editline confirm buttons consistence margin left in todo cards

now:
    -bug: click editProjSideBar, click cancel, click editProjSideBar, click input, makes the hidden line show
        happends other places with cancel button, something to do with a used click inside the confirm/cancel line
