# TOP-todo-list_B
2nd attempt: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list

Being that I was interrupted in this project for a few months and seeing some lacks in using modules and SOLID principles, I feel it would be good to redo the lessons leading up to this project and then do the project again, focusing on the bare-bones of what is being asked. This allows me to refresh the concepts I learned months ago, correct my mistakes, and move forward.



personal notes:
    -create all in console first (ensure no DOM dependancy)
    -SOLID (focus on single responsibility)

completed: 
Did it. I think it was a good call to restart. Feels like I really internalied the single responsibility principle. 

Things I'd of done different:
    -No lean so heavy on renderAll(). There are a few places where only rendering part of the DOM seems like better UI (feels like I can move on though)
    -Split up renderModule.js (it's easy enough to navigate, but it got pretty big)
    -Used the data attribute in elmenets for js manipulation (vs classes and id's)
